# Planet Lander

We know how important is to get kids into STEM knowledge. That's why we are making a game about landing in other planets.

It will be as real as we can get make it. In that way the kids will not just have fun, they will be learning about the many factors that take place to land on differents places like:

+ Atmosphere friction
+ Gravity
+ Fuel
+ Lander mass
+ Lander's thrusters
+ Planet' wind forces (where applied)
+ Terrains
+ History about previous landings
